Bean Classification Project

The Bean Classification project aims to classify seven different types of dry beans commonly found in Turkey: Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermason, Horoz, Seker, and Sira. The classification is based solely on the dimension and shape features of the bean varieties, without considering any external discriminatory features.


Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

Area (A): The area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries. 

Perimeter (P): Bean circumference, defined as the length of its border. 

Major axis length (L): The distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean. 

Minor axis length (l): The longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis. 

Aspect ratio (K): Defines the relationship between L and l. 

Eccentricity (Ec): Eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region. 

Convex area (C): Number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed. 

Equivalent diameter (Ed): The diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area. 

Extent (Ex): The ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area. 

Solidity (S): Also known as convexity. The ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans. 

Roundness (R): Calculated with the following formula: (4Ï€A)/(P^2) 

Compactness (CO): Measures the roundness of an object: Ed/L 

ShapeFactor1 (SF1) 

ShapeFactor2 (SF2) 

ShapeFactor3 (SF3) 

ShapeFactor4 (SF4) 

Class: The target variable indicating the type of bean (Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermason, Horoz, and Sira) 

Objective 

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the seven types of beans based on their dimension and shape features. The model should be able to generalize well to unseen data and provide reliable predictions. 


Methodology 

Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values (if any), and check for outliers or anomalies in the dataset. Prepare the data for model training. 


Feature Selection: Analyze the importance and correlation of features to determine the most relevant features for classification. Remove any redundant or irrelevant features. 


Model Selection: Choose the best machine learning algorithm for the bean classification task. Consider algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks. Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare and select the best model.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected model on the training data using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, or feature scaling. 


Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using the chosen evaluation metrics. Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness in classifying the bean types. 


Model Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for real-time predictions on new, unseen data. Provide clear instructions on how to use the deployed model.
